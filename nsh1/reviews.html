    Madrid, Spain<br>
"I enjoyed touring Spain, especially Madrid! I got a lot of stares, but overall, I felt pretty safe in the area. When I touched down into the airport, I was asked to take pictures by a myriad of locals, but it was nothing too out there or unexpected. I visited the Royal Palace, the Prado Museum, and multiple neighborhoods around like Lavapiés and Malasaña. Although the stares from locals were a little uncomfortable, I did not let that stop my trip and had a fun time!"

    Dameon Ming<br>
    Seoul, South Korea<br>
    "When I visited Korea over the holiday, I ended up having such a horrible experience. Not only did my hostel workers act discriminatory towards me, they overcharged me for way more than was in the original bill. Although my hostel did not turn out as planned, I still tried to enjoy experiencing the Korean street food culture such as tteokbokki and visiting Seoul tourist attractions, such as the Gyeongbokgung Palace. While walking from place to place, I received a lot of unwanted attention, and felt slightly unsafe with the amount of people coming up to me."

    Faren Thompson<br>
    Amsterdam, Netherlands<br>
    "I really enjoyed going to Amsterdam and I had booked my trip on an Amsterdam cruise to have a fun trip through the canal where I ate snacks and drinks with a smaller group. I enjoyed going bike riding in the City Center and then looking through the Noordermarkt, which is the local flea market. I had booked with a cruise company and felt safe because I was in a small group. If you plan to travel to Amsterdam, I would highly recommend booking with a tourist group.

    <img src="Japan-2107x1406.jpg" alt="Japan">
    <p class="description">During my trip in Japan, I didn't receive any racist comments or underlying behaviors from the locals. I felt very welcomed by everyone here and one of my personal dangers was the African men in Tokyo. I even got grabbed by one on the way to one of my travel spots. I love the way the Japanese embrace other cultures, and things like that aren't as broadcasted on the internet. It is a very safe way for black women, and you should definitely travel to Japan!

    Gabriel Epperson<br>
    Reykjavik, Iceland<br>
    "During my solo trip to Iceland, I felt completely safe. I didn't get any weird stares or feel any sense of aggression towards me. I think something that really helped me feel safer is that I booked a tour with a private tourist group. The weather was perfect and I loved seeing the beautiful summer landscapes"

    Shamar Samuels<br>
    Accra, Ghana<br>
    "I went to Ghana with a group of friends this summer and thoroughly enjoyed the trip. I loved the cuisine and visited the Polo Beach Club. Next, we visited the W.E. Dubois museum and had an enriching experience learning more about Ghanaian history. My overall favorite experience was eating traditional Ghanaian jollof with pepper soup, and fufu. I felt very safe overall, but I'd highly recommend traveling within a smaller group."

        Sophy Joasil<br>
        Sharm El Sheik, Egypt<br>
        "I had such a bad experience in Egypt. Although I did enjoy the scenery, I was overcharged for almost every item and felt very uncomfortable by the amount of people coming up to me. Once, on the way back to my hostel, I was hustled by a "fake taxi driver", who overcharged me and wouldn't let me leave unless I paid him a certain amount. If I were to go again, I would definitely have booked my trip with a private tourist group for that extra security."
